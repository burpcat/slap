"""Event-sourced tracking store (Build Order step 5).

One SQLite file, two tables. `events` is the only source of truth and is
append-only — never updated, never deleted. `recipients` is a derived cache
for fast current-state, fully rebuildable by replaying `events` (rebuild()).
See SLAP_BUILD_PROMPT.md §5.

Design decisions not fully pinned down by the brief (documented here and in
CONTROL_SHEET.md, revisit when steps 6/9/10 wire in real callers):

- `run_started`/`run_completed`/`run_failed` describe a drain's own
  lifecycle, not one recipient — they're appended to `events` for the
  dashboard's "Today's runs" panel (§8) but never touch `recipients`.
- The `recipients.status` value 'done' (sequence exhausted, no reply) has no
  dedicated event type in the brief's enum. Convention adopted: a `sent`
  event's `meta` may include `"is_final_stage": true` (the caller knows the
  persona's cadence length at send time) — that marks status='done' instead
  of 'active'. Without it, `sent` always leaves status='active'.
- `persona` isn't a fixed `events` column, so it must ride in a `queued`
  event's `meta` (e.g. `{"persona": "recruiter"}`) — the caller knows it at
  queue time. This keeps `recipients` a pure function of `events` alone
  (rebuildable without consulting live, possibly-since-changed config).
- `draft_created` (added at step 9) is not in the brief's original §5 enum.
  §3's idempotency rule requires recording the draft ID "the instant step 1
  returns, before step 2 fires" — the original enum had no event type for
  "a GMass draft exists but hasn't been sent yet," which is exactly the
  window a crash/retry needs to detect to avoid orphaning or double-creating
  a draft. It's recipient-scoped but cache-inert (an audit/idempotency
  marker only — `_apply_event_to_cache` no-ops on it), so it doesn't disturb
  the `recipients` status machine.
- `ooo_tagged`/`requeued` (step 10) mirror `queued`/`sent`: `ooo_tagged` is
  the "due for an OOO resend" marker (owner tagged a reply as OOO — a rare
  false-positive safety net, §7); `requeued` is the completion marker,
  written once the app's own resend of the recipient's next stage actually
  succeeds. `requeued` advances `current_stage`/`last_gmass_campaign_id`
  exactly like `sent` does, and flips status back to `'active'` — which is
  *why* no new schema column was needed to track "still pending resend":
  `slap.queue.due_for_ooo_resend()` just queries `status = 'ooo_requeued'`,
  since a successful `requeued` naturally removes a recipient from that set.
- `reply_reviewed` (added at step 11) is not in the brief's original §5 enum.
  §8's dashboard lets the owner tag a reply real/OOO/not-interested; OOO
  already has a real event (`ooo_tagged`) with backend consequences, but
  "real"/"not-interested" have none — they're pure triage bookkeeping, not
  state transitions, since neither is a valid `recipients.status` value.
  Without SOME event marking "the owner already looked at this reply,"
  every reply would show as needing triage on the dashboard forever.
  `reply_reviewed` (meta `{"tag": "real"|"not_interested"}`) is cache-inert,
  like `draft_created` — `slap.dashboard.needs_triage()` finds replies whose
  latest reply-lifecycle event (`reply`/`ooo_tagged`/`reply_reviewed`) is
  still `reply`, the same "any later closing event resolves it" pattern as
  `due_for_ooo_resend()`.
- `template-reload` (post-launch, `slap.reload`) deliberately did NOT get a
  new event type for its per-recipient failure reports, unlike every event
  type documented above. The difference: those all needed to affect the
  `recipients` cache (a real state transition) or be replayable truth. A
  reload failure is neither — it's a disposable diagnostic about the CURRENT
  attempt only, explicitly superseded wholesale by the next attempt (see
  `slap.reload`'s own module docstring for "unresolved failures from the
  most recent run"). More importantly, this table's `type` column has a SQL
  CHECK constraint (below) baked into every already-existing, populated
  `slap.db` at table-creation time — adding a literal value to it needs a
  full table rebuild, not an `ALTER TABLE`, a live-data-migration risk this
  diagnostic-only feature has no reason to take on (the exact same
  reasoning `slap.dashboard._sync_blocks()` already applied once, reusing
  `bounce` + a `meta["category"]` discriminator instead of a new `block`
  type). `slap.reload` instead writes a small JSON file, fully overwritten
  on every run.
- `reply_reviewed`'s `meta["tag"]` vocabulary grew a third value, `"unreal"`
  (post-launch: the Reach-outs "Unreal" action, `slap.dashboard.tag_reply`).
  A Real-tagged recipient going cold is real history, not a mistake to
  unwind — so this is a fourth, purely-additive tag value on the SAME
  cache-inert event type, not a rewrite of the original `reply_reviewed(tag=
  real)` event, exactly like `not_interested` before it never rewrote a
  prior `real`. `slap.dashboard.reply_tags()`'s existing "latest reply-
  lifecycle event wins" resolution already handles it with zero changes —
  a later `unreal` simply outranks the earlier `real` the same way any
  later reply_reviewed already outranks an earlier one.
- `stopped` (post-launch, "Stop outreach" — `slap.dashboard.stop_outreach`)
  is a genuinely NEW state transition, unlike `unreal` above: it must
  actually remove a recipient from every active-only query
  (`slap.queue.due_recipients`/`due_for_ooo_resend`,
  `slap.dashboard.pipeline`'s followups_scheduled) the same way `bounced`/
  `done` already do, which only a real `recipients.status` value can do —
  a cache-inert meta discriminator on an existing type (the `reply_reviewed`
  precedent above, or bounce/block's `meta["category"]` below) was never a
  fit here, since neither of those event types' handlers touch `status` in
  the one way this needs. That means it — unlike template-reload's
  diagnostic above — genuinely needs a new CHECK-constraint literal, so
  `connect()` runs a one-time, idempotent migration
  (`_migrate_events_check_constraint`, below) that rebuilds `events` in
  place for any already-existing db still missing it, rather than reusing
  an existing type just to dodge that migration. Scoped to exactly ONE
  recipient (`meta["scope"] = "recipient"`, confirmed with the owner — a
  literal whole-persona/campaign stop was explicitly ruled out given the
  blast radius) — see `stop_outreach()`'s own docstring for the full
  rationale and its GMass-suppression-first ordering, identical to
  `ooo`/`not_interested` above.
- `recipients.cadence` (post-launch: per-recipient follow-up override) is a
  nullable JSON-encoded list, populated from a `queued` event's own
  `meta["cadence"]` (`slap.queue.stage_recipient` always includes it — the
  effective, possibly owner-truncated cadence actually staged for THIS
  recipient, not necessarily the persona's full default). This is a plain
  `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`, not a CHECK-constraint literal like `stopped`
  above, so it needs none of that migration's rename/recreate dance — SQLite
  supports adding a nullable column to an existing table natively.
  Before this column existed, `slap.runner._estimate_followups_firing_today`/
  `slap.dashboard._followups_scheduled`/`slap.cleanup.classify_recipient` all
  silently assumed a recipient's cadence was always exactly
  `global_config.personas[persona]` — this column lets them prefer the
  recipient's own recorded cadence instead, falling back to the persona
  default only for `queued` events written before this feature shipped
  (missing key = unknown, never fabricated, the same convention every other
  additive `meta` field in this module follows).

def _migrate_events_check_constraint(conn: sqlite3.Connection) -> None:
    """One-time additive migration for the `stopped` event type (Stop
    outreach, post-launch — see this module's own docstring for why it
    genuinely needed a new CHECK-constraint literal instead of reusing an
    existing type). A brand-new `slap.db` never hits this at all — its
    `events` table doesn't exist yet, so `_SCHEMA`'s own `CREATE TABLE IF
    NOT EXISTS` below creates it correctly, already including `'stopped'`,
    with zero migration involved. An already-existing, already-populated db
    file has the OLD constraint baked in permanently instead — `CREATE
    TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` is a no-op against it, and SQLite has no `ALTER
    TABLE ... ADD CHECK VALUE` (the identical limitation
    `slap.dashboard._sync_blocks()` sidestepped by reusing `bounce` instead
    of adding a `block` type — not an option here, see the module docstring).

    Detects which case applies by reading the table's OWN recorded CREATE
    TABLE text back from `sqlite_master` and checking for the literal
    `'stopped'` value already in it — idempotent and safe to call on every
    `connect()`, no separate schema-version table needed (this app has never
    had one, and a single additive migration doesn't justify introducing
    one now).

    Migrates by the standard SQLite "12-step" rename-recreate-copy-drop
    dance: every existing row (append-only, so every row is real history —
    §5) is copied across verbatim, including `id`, so no event silently
    changes identity or ordering.

    **Must actually be atomic — an iron-audit BLOCKER fix.** An earlier
    version of this function claimed to run "inside one transaction" but
    didn't: it drove the RENAME/CREATE/COPY/DROP sequence via a mix of
    `conn.execute()` and `conn.executescript()`, and `executescript()` (per
    Python's own sqlite3 docs) issues an implicit `COMMIT` of any pending
    transaction before it runs its script — durably committing the RENAME
    (and, separately, the CREATE) the instant each ran, regardless of
    whether `conn.commit()` was ever reached. A crash between the RENAME
    and the final `DROP TABLE` left `events_pre_stopped_migration` holding
    every real historical event while a brand-new, EMPTY `events` table
    (already containing `'stopped'` in its schema text) sat next to it —
    and since the guard below only ever inspects the live `events` table's
    own SQL, the very next `connect()` would read that empty table, see
    `'stopped'` already present, and conclude "already migrated" —
    silently and permanently stranding the entire event log. Verified live
    (not just reasoned about): `conn.executescript()` force-commits even a
    transaction this function had ALREADY opened itself via `BEGIN`, so
    simply adding an explicit `BEGIN` around the old code would not have
    fixed it either — `executescript()` cannot be used anywhere inside this
    function at all.

    Fixed by driving every step through `conn.execute()` (never
    `executescript()`) inside one explicit `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` — SQLite itself
    fully supports transactional DDL (CREATE/ALTER/DROP TABLE all roll back
    cleanly), it's specifically Python's sqlite3 module that force-commits
    around non-DML statements unless an explicit transaction is already
    open AND nothing inside it calls `executescript()`. With this fix, a
    real interrupted migration (process killed, power loss, an unrelated
    exception mid-copy) is rolled back by SQLite's own crash-recovery
    (WAL/journal replay) on the very next open — no special-case "leftover
    migration table" detection needed, and none is present here on
    purpose: there is never a moment where a half-migrated state is
    durably observable to a later `connect()` call, so there is nothing
    for such a check to find."""
